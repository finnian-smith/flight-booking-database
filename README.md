# Flight Booking Database

The goal of this project was to model and build a database for a flight booking system.
The database is in the form of a relational database system.

The airline easyJet was selected as the archetype to mimic.
The design of this project was developed by reverse engineering easyJetâ€™s web database and analysing the features of their site.
The specific scope of this project included only that of which easyJet has control over, with third party organisations being ignored (e.g. Accommodation, Car Rental, Zurich Travel Insurance).

An entity-relationship model was constructed as a result of this work, which provided the basis for the implementation of the database through MySQL.

For demonstration purposes, the database has been populated with a small sample set of example data.
